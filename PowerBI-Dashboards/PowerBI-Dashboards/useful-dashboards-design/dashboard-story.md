# Dashboard Design: From Chaos to Clarity

**Tool:** Power BI  
**Skills:** Data storytelling, KPI reduction, dashboard design, business communication

---

## Project Summary

In one of my earlier projects, I built a highly detailed Power BI dashboard with over 20 KPIs. But it was barely used by stakeholders. The problem? **It wasn’t helping them make decisions**.

This inspired me to redesign the dashboard from a user’s perspective.

## Key Learnings

- Reduced KPIs from 20+ to 5 core metrics aligned to business goals
- Used conditional formatting to highlight trends and anomalies
- Designed with color psychology to guide user attention
- Added text-based summaries with key takeaways

---

## Before & After

**Before:** Data-heavy, complex, overwhelming  
**After:** Clear, minimal, insight-driven  

This project helped me understand that **good dashboards don’t just show data—they guide decisions.**
