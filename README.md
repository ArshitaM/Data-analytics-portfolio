# Arshita | Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi! I'm Arshita, a CS Engineer with 4 years of experience in analysis and configuration. I recently made a bold moveâ€”leaving my job to pursue a data analytics career I truly enjoy.

This portfolio is a collection of my learning journey and hands-on projects in:

- **SQL** (Advanced queries, window functions, business problem solving)
- **Power BI** (Insightful dashboards, KPI design, storytelling)
- **Python** (Data cleaning, analysis, visualization)
